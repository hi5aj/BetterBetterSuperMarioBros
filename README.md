Scene 2 Tilemap Legend - (Tiles are referenced in order of how they appear from left to right)
Bare Desert Blocks w/ no grass - May or may not be removed, only serve as an additional layer under the standard ground block
Desert Blocks w/ grass - The standard platforming block
Rock Tile floating slightly above the ground - Coin/Multi-coin Block, Powerup Block (see further for explanation)
   Regular coin blocks are ones that are placed directly above grassy ground blocks, in close proximity to stairs, or are less than two tiles above the currently parallel ground block
   Multi-coin Blocks and Powerup Blocks are always placed at least two tiles above the nearest ground block (ratio of powerup to multi-coin blocks can be determined by the artist, but try to split them evenly)

Stack of Desert Blocks topped by Water Block - Represent pipes
Quarter Circle Grass Block w/ Rock Trim - Represent enemy tiles
Small Rock Tile w/ slight amount of grass towards the bottom - Represent environmental hazards (current idea is ice spikes, these blocks should only be placed in pits or directly above a grassy desert block)
Rock Tile w/ grass top - Stair blocks (should always be stacked in the form of a classic Mario stair)
Bare Desert Blocks topped by green circle - Represent the ending flag
